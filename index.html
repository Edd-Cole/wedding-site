            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our wedding website where we will provide you all the information you will need to join us on our special days. Yes, days! Indian
            weddings last much longer than traditional western weddings. In fact, ours will last 3 days with a rest day in between.</p>
            <p>The main event will happen over these days:</p>
            <p><em>30th January 2023 - 2nd February 2023</em></p>
            <p>We recommend arriving at least 24 hours before the first day as it takes around a day to travel to Aurangabad.</p>
            <p>You will also need to book flights, prepare your visa, prepare your covid status, and holiday arrangements. Understandably, this is a lot to ask
            so if you cannot manage this, we understand.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we are keeping this information up to date. If there is some piece of information missing, it will be added in the future. We are focusing
            on the most important pieces of information first and then the fun stuff. If you do have questions, do drop either myself of Sanu a message!</p>
