            <h3 class="heading">Getting a Paper Application Form</h3>
            <p>To get a paper application form, you will need to fill out the following online form <a
                    href="https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
            <p>In order to fill it out completely, you will need the following items:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Passport</li>
                <li>A digital 2 x 2 inch passport style photo. It will need to be between 10 - 300 KB, and must be a
                    JPEG
                    document type. Refer below for an example image
                </li>
                <li>If you have previously been to India, you will need your old Visa</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><strong>Important Tips</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Your visa starts at the date of issue, not when you first land, be sure that you make the visa at
                    least
                    6 months long!
                </li>
                <li>If you make a mistake after completing the form, you will have to create another form. You cannot
                    edit
                    it out
                </li>
                <li>If you want to change your application form after you have booked your appointment, it is fine to do
                    so.
                    I made 3 submissions and only ever had 1 appointment
                    they do not check the online form at the Indian Mission, only the paper copies
                </li>
                <li>If you need an appointment now but don't have all the docs you need, use false data, get the
                    appointment,
                    and be sure to come back and resubmit a new form
                </li>
                <li>I highly recommend getting the photos done professionally, I saw a few people have to redo their
                    entire
                    application because they did not have the correct photo uploaded or with them at the Indian Mission
                </li>
                <li>Do as much of the application, printing and preparation for your visa at home. The Indian Mission
                    does
                    have a photocopier and 2 computers, but you will have to pay hefty prices to use them
                </li>

                pages,
                will be your visa</p>
